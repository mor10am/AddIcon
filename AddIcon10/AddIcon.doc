 AddIcon V1.0
 by Morten Amundsen, Hjuksebø, 3670 NOTODDEN, NORWAY (TEL: 35 95 74 57)

 	AddIcon is a small program that lets you add any icon to a
 list of files, while also specifying what should be the default
 tool for all files that are NOT executable (defaults to 'MultiView').

 AddIcon has the following template: FILES/A/M,ICON/A/K,TOOL/K

 Ex.
 >AddIcon foo.exe foobar.txt barfoo.txt ICON=GFX:Icons/TestIcon TOOL=more

 This will add the icon 'GFX:Icons/TestIcon.info' to 'foo.exe',
 'foobar.txt' and 'barfoo.txt' and the two textfiles will be given
 'More' as a default tool.

 PS! The iconname should NOT have a trailing '.info'!

 WARNING!
	I, Morten Amundsen, take no, and I mean NO, responsibility for
	files that are lost or in any way mysteriously, magically missing!
 

 Enjoy!
